NOTES: cmm [ν. 5 3-1'. 5 4·

de Oratore i. 5 155.
sua ipse persona: in his own name, and not merely by the
mouth of one os the persons os a dialogue‚ like Crassus in the De
Oratore. 'l'hcre are no passages in Cicero's extant writings that
account sor the words frequentissime praecipit: cp.‚ however,
Brutus 5 310, and Marcus Cicero in ad Fam. xvi. 2ι, 5. The in-
troductions to De Officiis and De Finibus contain cicero·s advocacy
os the study os Greek.
libros Platoni· atquo xenophontis. Cicero translated, at about
the age of 2ο years (de Off. ii. 5 87)·the Oeconomicus of Xenophon:
in early lise also the Protagoras of Plato, ,and later the Timaeus.
hoc genero: 3 ς’ 26: and below 5 7.
Montanae: v. ι 5 22 and 5 ¹13 with the notet.
‘Hyperidis pro Phryne: Quintilian refers to the well-known
story ii. 15, 9. For Hyperides v. 1 5 77, and note.
difficillima Romania subtilitate. Cp. 1, '5 100 curn sermo ipse
· Romanus non recipcre videatur illam solis concessam Atticis
venerem. For subtilitas cp. 1 5 78, 2 5 19. There is a brachyology
in cum illa . . ..subtilitatez it is difficult to take subtilitate with
contenderet.
5 3. auctores: see on 1 5 24· ᾗ 3.
transferentibus : personal dat. after licet.
nostris is predicative=omnia enim quibus utimur nostra sunt.
. Translation from the Greek leaves us free to choose the best ex-
pressions: it is not like translation from Latin (i. e. reproduction or
paraphrase)‚ where wc must often borrow from our models (optimis
occupatis 5 5).
figuras. Cp. on 1 5 50. 'In ix. 1 5 4 Quintilian defines figura
broadly as ‘conformatio quaedam orationis remota a communi et
primum se offerente ratione.’ Here he refers both to rhetorical and
to grammatical figures.
5 4. multum et ipfaeipsa quoque. ‚multum contulerit.‘ even ᾗ 4.
· paraphrase os itselsss i. e. apart from translation. See on 1 5 31 and
cp. 5 2ο below, 6 5 r: 75 26. Cicero uses ψει by rtself or ipse
etiamt Livy, ipse quoque. .
contulerit· v. on 1 5 37.
de carminibus has been wrongly taken as referring to Greek
poetry. Quintilian is commending exercises in ⁸ reproduction ’ or
⁸ pamphrase: ·
