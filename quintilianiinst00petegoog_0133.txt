tots nostra. Tuis claim must be understood ol satire in its ,
Roman form. Tne spirit ol personui invective had already lound
expression in the lumpoons ol Greek satire, e. g. in the iambics oi
Archilochus and Hipponax, to say nothing ol the old Comedy at
Athens; bnt Satine at Rome grew to be n distinct art, a serious
practical uim being imposed on the liternry iorm that was developed
out οἰ the original Satura (lor which see below, ς 95). The claim
made by Quintilian springs irom the conscionsness thnt Satine was
preemineutly the national organ oi public opinion at Rome. More·
over, it was the only form oi literature that enjoyed a continuone
development, extending usit did lrom the most flonrishing era oi tbe
Commouwealth into the second century oi the Empire.

Lucilius, 0. (cc. 168 (l)-103l gave Satire its true popular tone
at Rome, speaking ont openly and with a courugeous lrnnkness
against ¹the iniquity aud incompetence ol the nobles, the sordid,
avaricious and pleesure·seekingai1us ol the middle-class, and the

- venulity ol the mob. Horace pasees a rather mixed y'udgment on
him, censuring his discursivcuess, rouglrness‚ careless rapidity, aud
verbosityy but commending him lor his original ioroe and iranlr
outspolrenness. See Sat. i. 4,6-12, 57: 10,1-5, 20-24, 48-71:
ii 1, 17, 29-34, 62-75, In the time oi Tacitus some preferred
Lucilius to Horace: Dial. 23.
