5 18. se expressisse. This unusual construction (aster sibi ᾗ 18.
viderentur=pcrsuasum haberent) may be intended to indicate that
these imitator-s are thoroughly convinced of their own excellence,
whatever the opinion of others may be (sibi, sc. non aliis). So
sometimes with mihi videtur in the sense of mihi placet: 1 5 91.

caelestis: 1 5 86.

esse videatur: T ac. Dial. 23 illud tertio quoque sensu in omni-
bus orationibus pro sententia positum ‘ esse videatur.’ An instance
occurs below 7 5 ²9·

primum est ut: cp. rarum est ut 5 7, 24.

imitabilia : i. e. there are some things which are (in themselves)

fortia et abrupta ε a ‘ bold and rugged style,’ the latter quality

Cp. Cic. de Orat. ii. 183. So below 5 ²3 ‘ lene ac remissum genus
causarum ’ is that which calls sor ‘ lene ac remissum genus dicendi.’

indomitum: ‘violent,’ unbridled, unrestraincd. In such a case
the genus dicendi grande atque robustum will be more appropriate
than the genus subtile: cp. 1 5 44. For the union of subtilitas and
elegantia cp. 1 5 78.

et . . . et. He loses vis and sails to secure elegantia at one and
the same time. The construction occurs (instead of aut . . . aut)
when the writer wishes to indicate that the coincidence of the two
should be guarded against.

indecens is found in Petronius, Seneca, and Martial. The Cicero·
uian equivalent is indecorum. .

mollis-lenia, dulcia. He might have added, having regard to
what has gone before, aut cum dura molliter.

in libro secundet ch. 8 where he discusses the question An
secuudum sui quisque ingenii naturam docendus sit. The conclusion
arrived at there might seem inconsistent with what he is nnw mying,
so this paragraph is added to clear away the cunundi-nien.

formator belongs to the Silver Age.
