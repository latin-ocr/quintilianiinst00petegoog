· historiae auctoritas. So Kiderlin explains a passage which has been
the subject of much discussion. Quintilian often uses gentas in this
sense without dicendi: e. g. a 5 18 noveram quosdam·&c.s 523

5 104. superest Some edd. understand the reference to bet05 104.
Tacitus, bnt this can hardly be accepted. Thrs words superest adhuc
are, in their natural sense (cp. a 5 28), inapplicable to one who had
not published anything when Quintilian wrote (about 93 Α.1).).
Th0ugh it may be proposed to take them as meaning simply ‘ 1 have

1 still to referto (a living writer),’ (cp. supersunt 5 123), in which
' oense the words might apply to Tacitus, it seems extremely improb
able that after speaking of a youthful contemporary, Quintilian
would in the next sentence return to Cremutius, who died as far back
as n. 0. ²5· lt might be argued that the point of the passage is that,
. after this indirect eulogy of Tacitus, the writer means to imply that
the spirit of Cremutius still survives in him: ‘there is with us now
onewbo will afterwards be hruons but of whom we may not speak
at present The independence of Cremutius is still appreciated'
Ι But habet anderes will hardly cover this interpretation: it intro·
duces a critique of Cremutius which seems to have no relation to
what goes before And moreorer it ia doubtful whether Quintilian,
who never mentions any living writer, except Domitian, would hare
haaarded a reference to one whose anti-imperial tendenciea must
bave been so well-known at Rome. It seems safest, therefore, to
follow those who understand the historica here meant to be F abina
