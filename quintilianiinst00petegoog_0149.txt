mntem . . . ridicula eet. This sentence is generally taken
in continuation ol the preire ol Cassius, attaching closely to
‘urbanitas'r the words from sed plus to dedit being then interjected
as the only note oi disparagement. The literal translation would
theu be ‘while his wit is bitter, the bitterness itsell is olten enough
to melre you nugh! But it muy be doubted il Quintilian or any
other writer who hud just been censuring Cassius lor storrrachus
would immediately go on (using nilr'culus iu a good sense) to say
that ‘osten when he is merely bitter without being witty (this is the
ioroe ol amaritudo ipsu, cp. note on ἱ 45) he makes you luugh!
Drollery can hardly be claimed lor aurelieved acrimoniousuess.

A better sense uun be obtained by taking urrrarr'ludo ipsa niiicula
ert us pert not ol the preire but ol the uensure oi Cassius, and iuter·
preting ridicula us ‘silly,' ‘absurd‚' ‘ridiculous,'-as osten in Cicero
aud Quintilian. The meaning then is ‘while his wit is bitter, yet
bitterness by itsell is silly,’ ie his wit hasa bitter turn, bnt where he
is (as osten) bitter without being witty, the result is poor. There is
undoubtedly something unsatisfactory about utunrarr' sales (su sunt),
which might well have a general reference. Kiderlin suggests ut
amualuramrr‘ sales: perhups ut amari sales ‚imm mount. It hus
even been proposed to taire sales literally, as ii Quintilian were
comparing actual salt which besu bitter teste with bitter witticismsr
